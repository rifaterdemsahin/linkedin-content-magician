# Tailwind CSS Package Path Export Error

This document explains the error related to the Tailwind CSS package path exports and how it was resolved.

## The Error

When running the Vite development server, the following error occurred:

```
[plugin:@tailwindcss/vite:generate:serve] Package path ./base is not exported from package /Users/rifaterdemsahin/projects/linkedin-content-magician/5_Symbols/node_modules/tailwindcss (see exports field in /Users/rifaterdemsahin/projects/linkedin-content-magician/5_Symbols/node_modules/tailwindcss/package.json)
```

This error is caused by a change in how Node.js handles package exports, and it affects how Tailwind CSS directives are resolved.

## The Solution

To fix this, the `@tailwind` directives in the `src/index.css` file were replaced with `@import` statements:

**Before:**

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

**After:**

```css
@import 'tailwindcss/base';
@import 'tailwindcss/components';
@import 'tailwindcss/utilities';
```

This change ensures that the Tailwind CSS files are imported correctly, resolving the package path export error. Please restart your development server (`npm run dev`) to see the changes.
