# GitHub Pages Deployment Error Analysis - 404 Assets Issue

**Date:** October 25, 2025  
**URL:** https://rifaterdemsahin.github.io/linkedin-content-magician/  
**Error Type:** 404 Not Found on Asset Files  

## 🔴 Error Summary

GitHub Pages is serving an HTML file that references asset files with incorrect paths, resulting in 404 errors for JavaScript and CSS files.

### Failed Asset Requests:
1. `GET https://rifaterdemsahin.github.io/assets/index-NlJEQxv7.js` - **404 Not Found**
2. `GET https://rifaterdemsahin.github.io/assets/vendor-B_uAldPx.js` - **404 Not Found**  
3. `GET https://rifaterdemsahin.github.io/assets/index-CkVzJELX.css` - **404 Not Found**
4. `GET https://rifaterdemsahin.github.io/assets/ui-Bdf7vCn0.js` - **404 Not Found**

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Path Mismatch Issue
The HTML file served by GitHub Pages contains asset references with **absolute paths** starting from the domain root:
```html
<script type="module" crossorigin src="/assets/index-NlJEQxv7.js"></script>
<link rel="modulepreload" crossorigin href="/assets/vendor-B_uAldPx.js">
```

**Expected Path:** `https://rifaterdemsahin.github.io/assets/...`  
**Actual Required Path:** `https://rifaterdemsahin.github.io/linkedin-content-magician/assets/...`

### 2. Vite Build Configuration Problem
The assets are being built with incorrect base paths. The Vite configuration needs to account for the GitHub Pages subdirectory structure.

### 3. Deployment Source Confusion
Multiple index.html files exist in the repository:
- `/index.html` (redirect page)
- `/3_UI/index.html` (Bootstrap carousel)
- `/5_Symbols/index.html` (Vite source)
- `/5_Symbols/dist/index.html` (Vite build output) ⚠️ **This is causing the issue**

## 🎯 Specific Issues Identified

### Issue 1: Incorrect Base Path in Vite Config
The built HTML references `/assets/` instead of `/linkedin-content-magician/assets/`

### Issue 2: Wrong Deployment Source
GitHub Pages is likely deploying from the wrong directory or the wrong files are in the root.

### Issue 3: Content Security Policy Violation
Additional error shows CSP blocking blob scripts:
```
Refused to load the script 'blob:https://rifaterdemsahin.github.io/...' because it violates CSP directive
```

## ✅ Immediate Actions Required

### 1. Fix Vite Configuration
Update `5_Symbols/vite.config.js` to include correct base path:
```javascript
export default defineConfig({
  base: '/linkedin-content-magician/',
  // ... other config
})
```

### 2. Rebuild Assets
```bash
cd 5_Symbols
npm run build
```

### 3. Deploy Correct Files
Ensure GitHub Pages serves from the correct built directory with proper asset paths.

### 4. Verify GitHub Pages Settings
- **Source:** Deploy from `/ (root)` or from `5_Symbols/dist`
- **Custom domain:** None (using github.io subdirectory)

## 📊 Current File Structure Analysis
```
linkedin-content-magician/
├── index.html (redirect - OK)
├── 5_Symbols/
│   ├── dist/
│   │   ├── index.html (built with wrong paths - PROBLEM)
│   │   └── assets/ (files exist but wrong paths)
│   └── vite.config.js (needs base path fix)
```

## 🔧 Expected Fix Outcome
After applying fixes:
- Asset URLs should resolve to: `https://rifaterdemsahin.github.io/linkedin-content-magician/assets/...`
- All 404 errors should be resolved
- Application should load properly

## 📈 Impact Assessment
- **Severity:** High (Complete application failure)
- **User Impact:** Application non-functional
- **SEO Impact:** Negative (404 errors)
- **Fix Complexity:** Medium (configuration change + rebuild)
