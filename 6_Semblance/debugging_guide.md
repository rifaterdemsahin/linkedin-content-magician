# üêõ Debugging Guide for LinkedIn Content Magician

This document outlines the primary locations and methods for debugging the LinkedIn Content Magician application. A multi-faceted approach is necessary to effectively diagnose issues, as the system involves a frontend application, a serverless backend API, and a CI/CD pipeline.

## üìç Primary Debugging Locations

These are the first places you should look when you encounter an issue.

### 1. Vercel Deployments

*   **Where to check:** [Vercel Deployments Page](https://vercel.com/rifaterdemsahins-projects/linkedin-content-magician/deployments)

*   **Why it's important:** This is the central hub for the live application. It provides a high-level overview of the deployment status and is the gateway to more detailed logs.

*   **What to look for:**
    *   **Deployment Status:** Check if the latest deployment is in a "Ready" state. If it shows "Error" or "Canceled," it indicates a problem with the build process itself.
    *   **Build Logs:** For a failed deployment, the build logs are the most critical resource. They will show the output of the `npm run build` command and the Vercel build process, often pointing to the exact line of code or dependency that caused the failure.
    *   **Source:** Verify that the deployment was triggered from the correct Git commit.

### 2. GitHub Actions

*   **Where to check:** [GitHub Actions Workflow](https://github.com/rifaterdemsahin/linkedin-content-magician/actions/workflows/static.yml)

*   **Why it's important:** While Vercel has its own build process, this project also has a GitHub Actions workflow (`static.yml`). This workflow may run tests, linting, or other checks before the Vercel deployment is even triggered. It serves as the first line of defense against code quality issues.

*   **What to look for:**
    *   **Workflow Runs:** Look for a green checkmark (success) or a red X (failure) next to the latest commit.
    *   **Job Status:** If a workflow fails, inspect the logs for each job (e.g., `build`, `test`) to identify which step failed and why.

### 3. In-App Debug Output

*   **Where to check:** The main page of the application itself. Toggle the "üêõ Debug" button in the top-right corner.

*   **Why it's important:** This is a custom-built debugging tool that provides real-time insights into the application's internal state as you use it. It is invaluable for debugging issues related to the content generation process, RAG API, and n8n integration.

*   **What to look for:**
    *   **Processing Steps:** A step-by-step log of the content generation workflow.
    *   **RAG Data Sources:** Shows the prompt sent to the RAG API and the sources it retrieved.
    *   **Generated Content:** A preview of the content generated by the AI.
    *   **n8n Payload:** The exact JSON payload that is prepared to be sent to the n8n webhook.

##  secondary Debugging Locations

If the primary locations do not reveal the issue, these are the next places to look.

### 1. Vercel Function Logs

*   **Where to check:** On the Vercel dashboard, navigate to a specific deployment, and then go to the **Functions** tab.

*   **Why it's important:** The RAG API (`/api/rag-search`) is a serverless function. If the API endpoint is failing, the logs for this function are the *only* place to see why. This is separate from the build logs.

*   **What to look for:**
    *   **Runtime Errors:** Look for Python exceptions, such as errors loading the FAISS index, issues with dependencies, or timeouts.
    *   **Request and Response:** You can inspect the incoming request and the response being sent.

### 2. Browser Developer Tools

*   **How to access:** In most browsers, you can right-click on the page and select "Inspect," or press `F12`.

*   **Why it's important:** This is the primary tool for debugging any frontend web application.

*   **What to look for:**
    *   **Console Tab:** Look for JavaScript errors, warnings, and `console.log` messages.
    *   **Network Tab:** This is crucial for API debugging. You can inspect the request to `/api/rag-search`, see the payload, check the HTTP status code of the response, and view the response body. This is how we identified the "Not Found" error earlier.

### 3. Local Development Environment

*   **Why it's important:** The fastest way to debug is often to replicate the issue on your local machine. This allows you to make changes, add logging, and test fixes without having to wait for a new deployment.

*   **How to use:**
    *   Run the application locally using `npm run dev`.
    *   Use the browser developer tools and the terminal output to debug.
