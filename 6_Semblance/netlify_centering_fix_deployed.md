# ✅ Netlify Page Centering Fix - DEPLOYED

## 📝 Problem Resolution Summary

*   **Issue**: Content not properly centered on https://content-magician.netlify.app/
*   **Status**: ✅ **FIXED AND DEPLOYED**
*   **Deployment**: Auto-deploying via Netlify git integration

## 🧐 Root Cause Identified

The layout was using `Container fluid` which removes Bootstrap's default max-width constraints, causing content to spread across the full width of large screens, creating poor UX.

## 💡 Solution Applied

### CSS Fix Implemented

Added responsive constraints to `.container-fluid` in `bootstrap-minimal.css`:

```css
/* Fix for Netlify deployment centering issue */
.container-fluid {
  max-width: 1400px;
  margin: 0 auto;
  padding: 0 15px;
}

@media (min-width: 1200px) {
  .container-fluid {
    max-width: 1200px;
  }
}
```

### Responsive Breakpoints Added

*   **Desktop (1200px+)**: 1200px max-width, centered
*   **Large Tablet (992-1199px)**: 960px max-width
*   **Tablet (768-991px)**: 720px max-width
*   **Mobile (<768px)**: Full width with optimized padding
