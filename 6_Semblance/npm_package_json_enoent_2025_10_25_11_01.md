```

## Problem Analysis

### Root Cause
The npm command is looking for a `package.json` file in the root directory (`/Users/rifaterdemsahin/projects/linkedin-content-magician/`) but the actual `package.json` file is located in the `5_Symbols` subdirectory.

### Directory Structure Issue
```
linkedin-content-magician/          <- npm run dev executed here (❌ No package.json)
├── 5_Symbols/                     <- package.json is actually here (✅)
│   ├── package.json
│   ├── vite.config.js
│   └── src/
└── [other directories...]
```

### Command Context
Based on terminal history:
- User was running `npm run dev` from the root directory
- The actual Node.js/Vite project is in the `5_Symbols` subdirectory
- Previous successful npm commands were run from `5_Symbols` directory

## Error Classification
- **Type**: ENOENT (Error NO ENTry)
- **Category**: File System / Path Resolution Error
- **Severity**: Blocking (prevents development server startup)
- **Frequency**: Recurring issue when running npm commands from wrong directory

## Solution

### Immediate Fix
```bash
# Navigate to the correct directory with package.json
cd 5_Symbols

# Then run the dev command
npm run dev
```

### Long-term Prevention
1. **Always verify current directory before npm commands**:
   ```bash
   pwd
   ls -la package.json  # Verify package.json exists
   ```

2. **Create a root-level script** (optional):
   ```bash
   # In root directory, create run-dev.sh
   #!/bin/bash
   cd 5_Symbols && npm run dev
   ```

3. **Update documentation** to clearly specify working directory requirements

## Environment Information
- **Shell**: zsh
- **OS**: macOS
- **Node.js Project Location**: `5_Symbols/`
- **Project Type**: Vite + React + Tailwind CSS

## Related Files
- Target: `/Users/rifaterdemsahin/projects/linkedin-content-magician/package.json` (❌ Missing)
- Actual: `/Users/rifaterdemsahin/projects/linkedin-content-magician/5_Symbols/package.json` (✅ Exists)

## Recovery Status
- **Status**: Requires manual directory change
- **Next Action**: `cd 5_Symbols && npm run dev`
- **Prevention**: Always run npm commands from `5_Symbols` directory

## Error Pattern
This is a recurring pattern where npm commands are executed from the wrong directory. The project structure has the actual Node.js application in a subdirectory, which can cause confusion about where to run npm commands.
