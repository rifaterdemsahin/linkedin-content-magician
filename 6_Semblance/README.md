# üêû 6_Semblance: Error Logging & Solutions

**"Errors Found in the Process"**

### Premise
This folder is founded on the belief that errors are not failures, but valuable learning opportunities. Instead of just fixing a bug and moving on, this is the place to document the "what," the "why," and the "how" of the problem. By doing so, we turn every mistake into a lesson that strengthens the project and the team.

### Content
This directory serves as a project-specific troubleshooting guide and a log of lessons learned. For each significant error or bug encountered, a new markdown file should be created that documents:
- **The Problem:** A clear description of the error, including any error messages and the context in which it occurred.
- **The Investigation:** The steps taken to diagnose the issue.
- **The Solution:** A detailed explanation of the fix that was implemented.
- **The Lesson:** The key takeaway from the experience, which can help prevent similar issues in the future.

### Conclusion
By diligently documenting our mistakes, we create a powerful, searchable knowledge base that helps us solve problems faster in the future. It transforms errors from frustrating setbacks into valuable assets that contribute to the long-term health and stability of the project. **Fix it.**
