# ðŸš¨ Tailwind CSS PostCSS Plugin Error

This document explains the error related to the Tailwind CSS PostCSS plugin and how it was resolved.

## ðŸ“œ The Error

After setting up Tailwind CSS, the following error occurred:

```
[plugin:vite:css] [postcss] It looks like you're trying to use `tailwindcss` directly as a PostCSS plugin. The PostCSS plugin has moved to a separate package, so to continue using Tailwind CSS with PostCSS you'll need to install `@tailwindcss/postcss` and update your PostCSS configuration.
```

This error occurs because recent versions of Tailwind CSS have moved the PostCSS plugin to a separate package.

## ðŸ’¡ The Solution

To fix this, the following steps were taken:

1.  **Install the new dependency:** The `@tailwindcss/postcss` package was installed using npm:

    ```bash
    npm install -D @tailwindcss/postcss
    ```

2.  **Update the PostCSS configuration:** The `postcss.config.js` file was updated to use the new package:

    ```javascript
    export default {
      plugins: {
        '@tailwindcss/postcss': {},
        autoprefixer: {},
      },
    }
    ```

By making these changes, the application will now use the correct PostCSS plugin for Tailwind CSS, and the error will be resolved. ðŸš€
