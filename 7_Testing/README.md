# ✅ 7_Testing: Validation & Quality Assurance

**"Testing the code base to be able to reach the key results mentioned in the real folder."**

### 🎯 Premise

This folder is where we close the loop. A project is not complete when the code is written; it's complete when the code is proven to work and meets the goals we set out to achieve. This directory is dedicated to the critical process of testing and validation, ensuring that what we built is what we intended to build.

### 📂 Content

This is the home for all activities related to Quality Assurance (QA). Its purpose is to systematically verify that the application is correct, reliable, and performant. This includes:

*   **🧪 Test Plans:** Documents that outline the strategy for testing new features.
*   **📋 Test Cases:** Specific, step-by-step instructions for testing individual pieces of functionality.
*   **🤖 Automated Tests:** The source code for unit, integration, or end-to-end tests.
*   **📊 Test Results:** A log of test runs and their outcomes.

### 🏁 Conclusion

The work in this folder is the final and most crucial step in the development lifecycle. It directly connects back to the **Objectives and Key Results** defined in the `1_Real` folder. By rigorously testing our work, we validate that we have successfully met our goals and delivered a high-quality product. **Validate it.**
