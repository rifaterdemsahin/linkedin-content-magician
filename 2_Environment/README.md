# üó∫Ô∏è 2_Environment: Roadmap & Use Cases

**"The Roadmap and Use Cases"**

### Premise
Once the project's objectives are defined in `1_Real`, this folder is where we chart the course to reach them. It's about translating the "what" and "why" into a tangible "how" and "when." This directory establishes the project's strategic plan and ensures that all development work is grounded in real-world scenarios.

### Content
This folder contains the key documents that guide the project's execution:
- **Project Roadmap:** A high-level, visual timeline that outlines the major phases of development, key milestones, and planned feature releases. It provides a clear overview of the project's progression.
- **Use Cases:** Detailed descriptions of how users will interact with the application. Each use case outlines a specific scenario (e.g., "A user generates a new LinkedIn post from a blog article"), defining the actors, steps, and desired outcomes.
- **Environment Setup:** Documentation on how to set up the local development environment, including any necessary tools, dependencies, and configuration steps.

### Conclusion
This folder provides the essential structure for an organized and efficient workflow. The roadmap ensures we stay on track, the use cases ensure we build the right features, and the setup guides ensure that every contributor can get started quickly. **Create it.**
