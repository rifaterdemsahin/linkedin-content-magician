# AI CLI Agent Instructions for LinkedIn Content Magician

This document outlines how to use AI CLI agents to develop and maintain the `linkedin-content-magician` project. The project includes tools for LinkedIn automation, hosted on GitHub Pages, with source code in the `5_Symbols/src/` directory.

## Agent Setup

1. **Choose an AI CLI Agent**:
   - Recommended: Use tools like GitHub Copilot CLI, Claude Dev, or xAI's API (see [xAI API](https://x.ai/api) for details).
   - Ensure the agent supports JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and JSON (for n8n workflows).
