# Formula for Building the Vite Application

This document outlines the steps taken to build the Vite application located in the `5_Symbols` directory.

## 1. Initial Setup

- A `src` directory was created within `/Users/rifaterdemsahin/projects/linkedin-content-magician/5_Symbols` to house the source code.
- A basic `main.js` file was added to the `src` directory.

## 2. Configuring the Build Process

- The `package.json` file was modified to include a `build` script:

```json
"scripts": {
  "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
  "build": "vite build"
},
```

- Dependencies were installed using `npm install`.

## 3. Resolving the Build Error

The initial build failed due to JSX code being present in the `index.html` file. To resolve this:

1.  The React component code was moved from `index.html` to a new file, `src/App.jsx`.
2.  The `index.html` file was replaced with a standard HTML structure, including a `div` with the `id` of `root`.
3.  The `src/main.jsx` file was updated to render the `App` component into the `root` `div`.

## 4. Installing Missing Dependencies

The build process also failed due to a missing dependency, `lucide-react`. This was resolved by installing the package:

```bash
npm install lucide-react
```

## 5. Final Build

After these changes, the `npm run build` command was executed again, and the build completed successfully.
