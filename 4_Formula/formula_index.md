## Summary

I've successfully implemented the FAISS score display enhancement for the RAG sources in your LinkedIn Content Magician application! Here's what I accomplished:

### âœ… **Changes Made**

1. **Enhanced Data Structure**: Modified the RAG source handling to preserve detailed information including:
   - Title and file name
   - FAISS distance scores
   - Calculated similarity percentages

2. **Updated UI Display**: 
   - **Main RAG Sources Section**: Added percentage match badges next to each source
   - **Debug Section**: Shows both percentage scores and raw FAISS distance values
   - **File Information**: Displays the actual filename below each source title

3. **Score Calculation**: Converts FAISS distance to user-friendly percentage scores using the formula: `((1 - distance) * 100).toFixed(1)`

### ðŸŽ¯ **User Benefits**

- **Transparency**: Users can now see how relevant each retrieved source is to their query
- **Quality Assessment**: Easy identification of the most relevant content
- **Technical Insight**: Debug section provides raw FAISS metrics for technical users
- **Trust Building**: Clear scoring builds confidence in the AI-generated content

### ðŸ“Š **Visual Enhancement**

**Before:**
```
ðŸ“Š RAG Sources:
â€¢ Previous LinkedIn post about automation
â€¢ Video transcript from tech talk
```

**After:**
```
ðŸ“Š RAG Sources:
â€¢ Previous LinkedIn post about automation        [85.0% match]
  ðŸ“„ automation_strategy.md
  
â€¢ Video transcript from tech talk               [82.0% match]
  ðŸ“„ tech_talk_transcript.md
```

### ðŸ”§ **Technical Details**

- **Backwards Compatible**: Works with both new detailed source objects and legacy string format
- **Build Successful**: Application compiled without errors
- **No Performance Impact**: Minimal overhead for enhanced functionality
- **Documented**: Complete semblance document created for future reference

The enhancement is now ready for deployment and will provide users with much better visibility into how the RAG system is selecting and ranking source documents for content generation!
