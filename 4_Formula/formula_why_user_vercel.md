Excellent question — and this is a **really important distinction** between **GitHub Pages** and a platform like **Vercel**, especially when you’re working with Python and server logic.

Here’s the clear breakdown 👇

---

## 🧩 Short Answer

> ❌ **No, you cannot run Python or Vite server middleware directly on GitHub Pages.**
> ✅ **Yes, you would need Vercel (or a similar service like Render, Fly.io, or Cloudflare Workers) if you want your RAG Python API to run server-side.**

---

## 💡 Why GitHub Pages Won’t Work

GitHub Pages only hosts **static files** — HTML, CSS, JS, images, etc.
It **does not support server-side execution** of:

* Python scripts
* Node.js servers
* Vite middleware
* API routes (`/api/rag-search`)

So your `/api/rag-search` endpoint will **not run** there — you’d just get a “404 Not Found”.

---

## 🚀 Why Vercel Works (and When You Need It)

Vercel (and alternatives like Render, Deta, or Railway) **supports dynamic APIs**.

You can:

* Deploy your **frontend** (React/Vite/etc.) as static pages.
* Add your **backend** functions as serverless endpoints under `/api`.

Example structure for **Vercel**:

```
my-project/
├── public/
├── src/
├── api/
│   └── rag-search.py     <-- your Python RAG endpoint
├── vite.config.js
└── vercel.json
```

### `vercel.json` example:

```json
{
  "builds": [
    { "src": "api/*.py", "use": "@vercel/python" },
    { "src": "vite.config.js", "use": "@vercel/static-build" }
  ],
  "routes": [
    { "src": "/api/(.*)", "dest": "/api/$1" },
    { "src": "/(.*)", "dest": "/index.html" }
  ]
}
```

This way:

* Vercel hosts your static frontend.
* The `/api/rag-search` request triggers the Python function (`rag-search.py`).
* It returns JSON results from your RAG system.

## 🧠 Alternative Hybrid Setup

If you don’t want to move fully to Vercel:

* Keep your **frontend** on GitHub Pages.
* Host your **Python API** somewhere else (like Render or Hugging Face Spaces).
* Point your frontend to that external API endpoint, e.g.

  ```js
  fetch('https://rag-api.onrender.com/api/rag-search')
  ```

This hybrid approach works well if your Python logic is heavier or needs special dependencies (FAISS, LangChain, etc.).

| **GitHub Pages + External API (Render, Hugging Face, etc.)** | ✅ Yes                       | ✅ Yes           | ⭐⭐⭐⭐       |
| **Local Dev only**                                           | ✅ Yes (via Vite middleware) | ✅ Yes           | ⭐          |

If you show me your repo structure (or tell me where your `search_api.py` lives), I can give you a **ready-to-deploy Vercel config** that connects the Python API and your Vite frontend perfectly.
Would you like me to generate that next?
